# IOC LIST

This repository publishes dynamic IOC (Indicators of Compromise) lists containing malicious IP addresses for use in firewalls to automatically detect and block IPs associated with malicious activities and vulnerabilities.

## Repository Function
- **Collection and Updates:** Gather and maintain up-to-date lists of malicious IP addresses.
- **Security Integration:** Provide dynamic lists to facilitate easy integration into security devices.
- **Defense Against Vulnerabilities:** Help mitigate attacks related to known vulnerabilities, such as **CVE-2025-0108**, which is associated with authentication bypass attempts on PAN‑OS devices.

## Dynamic Lists Available to Date
- **[CVE-2025-0108.txt](https://github.com/alex-milla/IOCs/blob/main/CVE-2025-0108.txt):** Contains the IP addresses detected that are associated with authentication bypass attempts on PAN‑OS devices.
- **[OperationLunarPeek.txt](https://github.com/alex-milla/IOCs/blob/main/OperationLunarPeek.txt):** Based on the Palo Alto Networks Unit42 article, this list includes IOCs detected in the context of the Operation LunarPeek campaign.

The information is derived from analyses conducted on reputable sources and ongoing research to ensure that the lists reflect current threats.

We hope these lists help improve your network security! If you need further information or have any suggestions, please feel free to contact us.
