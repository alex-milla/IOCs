Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect Under Targeted Scanning SurgeA major reconnaissance surge has hit Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect login portals in early October 2025, signaling heightened threat activity for defenders and organizations using PAN-OS platforms.Threat Intelligence: Surge by the NumbersAccording to GreyNoise research, scanning attempts reached over&nbsp;2,200 unique IPs&nbsp;within 48 hours, representing a&nbsp;500% surge&nbsp;compared to baseline traffic.The spike began on&nbsp;October 3, when&nbsp;1,300 IPs&nbsp;triggered GreyNoise’s Palo Alto Networks Login Scanner tag, well above the daily average of under 200 IPs over the past three months.By&nbsp;October 7, the number of scanning IPs soared past&nbsp;2,200, marking the highest activity recorded in the last quarter.93%&nbsp;of involved IPs are classified as suspicious, with&nbsp;7%&nbsp;deemed malicious by GreyNoise threat analysis.The majority of scanning infrastructure (91%) is geolocated in the United States, with additional clusters in the UK, Netherlands, Canada, and Russia.Analysis: Who Is Targeting Palo Alto Portals?GreyNoise identified a notable increase in Autonomous System Number (ASN) diversity, indicating broader involvement from different operators and threat actors.About&nbsp;12% of all ASN11878 subnets&nbsp;were found to be participating in portal scans—suggesting attackers are iterating through substantial credential datasets.Most scan attempts focus tightly on Palo Alto GlobalProtect and PAN-OS login pages.This activity appears to be largely driven by automated or attacker-driven scans employing mass fingerprinting and public reconnaissance tools such as Shodan and Censys.Indicators of Compromise
