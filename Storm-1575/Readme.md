# Storm-1575 — Malware Hashes & IOCs

This repository contains Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), primarily file hashes, associated with the Storm-1575 threat actor and its malware campaigns. Maintained by Alex Milla, this resource supports threat intelligence, hunting, and defensive operations.

## Contents

- `Storm-1575_hashes_MD5.txt` — MD5 hashes of malware files
- `Storm-1575_hashes_SHA1.txt` — SHA-1 hashes (if available)
- `Storm-1575_hashes_SHA256.txt` — SHA-256 hashes (if available)

Plain text format; one hash per line for seamless integration with security tools.

## Usage

- Search for these hashes across endpoints, traffic, or forensic images
- Enrich and correlate events in SIEMs, EDRs, or threat platforms
- Accelerate response, blocking, and threat hunting activities
